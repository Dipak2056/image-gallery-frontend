# Front end of image-gallery

## My approach:

1. Initial setup is done by clearing the initial broiler-plate code.
2. I created a form which can accept file type.
3. I created 2 input fields one for the label and one for the files to be uploaded.
4. After a Form, I created a section to preview the images, with respective label.
5. End points are not created to fetch individual image and it's label, so all the images stored in database will be previewed here.
